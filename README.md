## Setup
Please see the main [Nerves installation docs](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/installation.html)
if you haven't used Nerves before.

You should also be using the following Elixir and Erlang versions:
* Elixir 1.6.6
* Erlang OTP 21

See the [EmbeddedElixir post on using ASDF-VM](https://embedded-elixir.com/post/2017-05-23-using-asdf-vm/)

This repository contains several Nerves example projects as sub-directories.
Most of these projects should work on all of the [Nerves supported targets](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/targets.html).

For detailed information on how to build an example, see the `README.md` in each application's root directory.
